The bollinger_bands function calculates Bollinger Bands, a popular technical analysis tool used by traders in financial markets. Bollinger Bands are particularly useful for assessing whether prices are high or low on a relative basis. They consist of three lines plotted on a price chart:

1. Middle Band: This is typically the simple moving average (SMA) of the closing prices over a specified number of periods (defined by the window parameter).

2. Upper Band: This is calculated by adding a specified number (multiple of standard deviations, given by num_std_dev) to the middle band.

3. Lower Band: This is calculated by subtracting the same specified number of standard deviations from the middle band.

Purpose and Problem Solving
Bollinger Bands help traders in several ways:

- Volatility Measurement: The width of the bands is determined by the volatility, measured using the standard deviation. Wider bands suggest higher volatility, and narrower bands suggest lower volatility.

- Trend Indication: During strong trends, prices may continuously touch or move along the band edges, indicating the strength and direction of the trend.

- Overbought and Oversold Levels: Prices touching the upper band might be seen as overbought (possibly indicating a selling opportunity), while prices at the lower band could be seen as oversold (possibly indicating a buying opportunity).

- Price Targets and Reversals: Traders might use the bands to set price targets or anticipate potential price reversals when the price moves back inside the bands after touching one of the outer bands.

Example in Market Analysis
Here's a typical scenario where Bollinger Bands might be used:

If a stock's price breaks through the upper band, a trader might see this as a signal that the stock is moving powerfully upwards and could either continue in this direction or retract soon, making it a point of interest for buying or selling depending on the market context and their strategy.
Conversely, if the price dips below the lower band, it might be an indicator that the stock is unusually low, which could either signal a good buying opportunity or a continued downward trend.
Overall, Bollinger Bands provide a structured approach to interpreting market price movements, helping traders make more informed decisions based on the current price in relation to historical volatility and price levels.
